# Himera Project
Description - A DEX integrated with an AI-powered trading agent. The trading agent (mammoth bot) analyzes market data, detects arbitrage opportunities, and executes trades automatically when the users want the agent to proceed. Users can assign their agents specific strategies, configure risk levels, and allocate funds depending on the parameters that the Users input. The trading agent (Mammoth Bot) dynamically adapts to real-time market conditions, optimizing trading performance to better provide insight to the end User.
